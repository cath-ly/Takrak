CAUSE
</h1>
<p>
Cause is strong, but what makes mine interesting is that I desire for those around me as well as I stay happy and have fun.
Whether it is finding passion in a hobby or an area of study, staying strong and pursuing the world the way you want is great.
Aiding someone to help them find happiness makes the world a greater place to co-exist with people.
